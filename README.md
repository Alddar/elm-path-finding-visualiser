# NI-AFP semestral project

The goal of this semestral work is to replicate some of the functionality of this algorithm [visualiser](https://clementmihailescu.github.io/Pathfinding-Visualizer/#) in elm 

The supporting functionality will be:
- creating and modyfing the grid with wall nodes, and the tart and end nodes.
- visualising 4 main path finding algorithms - BFS, DFS and Dijkstra
- setting the speed of the visualisatio
